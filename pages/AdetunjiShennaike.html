<h1>Hi! My name is Adetunji Shennaike</h1>
<h2>I am what most call ecentric!</h2>
<p>I have a very diverse skill set, mainly becuase of my belief that people werent meant to do or be great at just 1 thing. Everyone should aspire to be a master of multiple subjects and good at everything else they can get thier hands on.</p>
<p>My main life choice is Music. Music is a universal language, and its vocabulary is filled with dance moves, beats, and vocals. </p>
<p>I enjoy being around a variety of people and interacting with new environments, I feel I adapt well. I like to discover new things whenever i travel whether it be an entirely new place or something in a familiar place that i missed the last time. </p>
<p>I like to think outside the box when it come to figuring out ways to complete task and projects. as i want to keep as much originality as possible when doing anything that i put my name/brand on. </p>
<p>I am currently in the works of developing a company that does as much of a variety of things as its employees. This will take some time but i see it on the rise in the near future. </p>
<p>This is a glimpse into my life, and hopefully you will all get to see my end slate in the same area as the worlds greatest minds. </p>
